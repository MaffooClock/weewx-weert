# WeeRT

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

WeeRT is a realtime extension for [WeeWX](http://weewx.com), open-source software for 
your weather station. It consists of three, independent parts:
- The WeeRT uploader. This is a [WeeWX service](http://weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#The_weeWX_service_architecture), 
which arranges for your data to be uploaded from WeeWX to the WeeRT server.
- The WeeRT server, a real-time logging and display server, written in Javascript and running on 
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), using the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/). This
server listens for real-time data updates from WeeWX, then archives them in
an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/) database. It also acts
as a webserver for the WeeRT client.
- The WeeRT browser client, written in Javascript using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
It runs in a browser and interacts with the WeeRT server.

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the three different pieces:

![WeeRT architecture](./weert_architecture.jpg)

This utility is still EXPERIMENTAL, and will require some skill to install and administer.

In order to use WeeRT, there are three separate install and build procedures:

1. Install the WeeRT server.
2. Install the WeeRT uploader on WeeWX. This will post LOOP packets to the WeeRT server.
3. Build the WeeRT client, which will run on a browser.

Instructions follow.

## Installing the WeeRT server

1. Due to a limitation in WeeRT, the timezone of your server must be the same as your hardware.
Hopefully, this limitation can be lifted in the future. To change the timezone on Debian based
operating systems:

    ```shell
    $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
    ```

2. Install [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/). WeeRT was tested with
version 1.8.10. In particular, *InfluxDB Version 2.x will not work*! The following works on Ubuntu. 
    ```shell
   sudo apt install influxdb
    ``` 
 
3. If necessary, start it by whatever means is needed for your operating system. This works
on Ubuntu 22.04:

    ```shell
    $ systemctl start influxdb
    ```

4. Download and install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/). WeeRT was tested with version 18.10.0,
also known as LTS/Gallium. Later versions should work fine.

5. Download WeeRT from the git repository

    ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/tkeffer/weert-js.git
    ```

6. Enter the WeeRT sub-directory, and install the server dependencies

    ```shell
    $ cd weert-js
    $ npm install
    ```

7. Start the WeeRT server

    ```shell
    $ npm run start
    Listening on port 3000
    ```

8. To run the test suites, in another shell download and install `jasmine` globally

    ```shell
    $ npm install -g jasmine
    ```

9. Run the suites

    ```shell
    $ npm run test
    ```

## Installing the WeeRT uploader on WeeWX

The job of the uploader is to post LOOP packets to the WeeRT server (installed above).

1. Make sure you are running WeeWX V3.8 or later. Earlier versions do
not support the POST method used by the uploader.

2. Put the `weert.py` module (located in the `weewx_extensions` subdirectory) in the 
WeeWX `user` subdirectory.

3. Add the following to `weewx.conf`:

    ```ini
    [StdRestful]
        ...
        [[WeeRT]]
            host = localhost
            port = 3000
            user = weert
            password = weert

    ...

    [Engine]
        [[Services]]
            ...
            restful_services = ..., user.weert.WeeRT
    ```

4. Run `weewxd`

## Building and running the client

1. Install, then build the client libraries.

    ```shell
    cd client
   npm install
   npm run build
    ```

2. After making sure the WeeRT server is still running, open up a client at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


## General architecture
- The WeeRT server runs on [Node](https://nodejs.org/) using the [Express framework](http://expressjs.com/).
- The server offers a RESTful API ([described below](#API)) for storing, retrieving,
  and deleting data measurements.
- Data are stored in an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) server.
- Realtime updates are done through a publish - subscribe interface
  using [Socket.io](https://socket.io).
- The client asks for the necessary data through the API, then subscribes to any updates.
- The client view is managed by [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- The client data state is managed by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
- Realtime plots are done using [Recharts](http://recharts.org), a charting library, which uses
  React to create DOM elements. As of 15-Feb-2018 it is still in beta, but seems reasonably stable.

## Notes

### Pub-sub

When new LOOP packets come into WeeRT through the POST interface, they
are published using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) (an implementation of WebSockets).
Interested clients can subscribe to these publications.

### Subsampling

Every 5 minutes (configurable), the WeeRT server subsamples the raw, loop, data,
converting it into evenly spaced records. See file `config/ss_policies.js` for the subsampling
policies. By default, it is run every 5 minutes, uses measurement 'wxpackets' for its source,
and measurement 'wxrecords' as its destination.

### Retention policy

The retention time of the LOOP packets is set by a configuration file,
but the default is 24 hours. After that, they are discarded.

### Querying Influx

If you wish to query the database directly using the influx command-line client, you must
attach the retention policy name. For example, to see all packets a typical session might
look like (user inputs are in <b>bold</b>):

<pre>
$ <b>influx -username weert -password weertL</b>

</pre>

Note how the query asked for measurement `h24.wxpackets`, where `h24` is the default retention policy
used by WeeRT.

### Log entries

WeeRT can make voluminous entries into your system log. The WeeWX
uploader will make an entry every LOOP packet, as does the InfluxDB
database. This can mean thousands of entries per hour.

The number of uploader entries can be drastically reduced by
using option `log_success`:

```ini
[StdRestful]
    ...
    [[WeeRT]]
        ...
        log_success = false
```

Consult the [InfluxDB configuration documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.3/administration/config/)
for how to control its logging policies.

### Observation names

WeeRT uses a different system to name observation types than WeeWX.
For example, for outside temperature, WeeWX uses `outTemp`, while
WeeRT uses `out_temperature`. The general pattern is that the last
part of the observation name, `temperature` in this example, denotes
the unit group. In WeeWX the unit group must be looked up in a table;
in WeeRT it can be inferred from the name.

Which brings us to the next topic...

### Units

Internally, the WeeRT server makes no assumptions about units.

The client is unit-agnostic, except for the WindCompass, which assumes US
Customary.

### Security

The server requires authentication for any mutating actions, that is,
any POSTs or DELETEs. The default configuration (file
`server/config/config.js`) includes a user `weert` with password
`weert`. These should, obviously, be changed.

The configuration for the WeeWX uploader in `weewx.conf` should be
changed to match the chosen username and password.

# Data model

## Background

It is strongly recommended that you read the ["key
concepts"](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/key_concepts/)
section of the InfluxDB documentation. In particular, be sure to
understand the concepts of measurements, tags, and fields. These terms
are used throughout WeeRT.

## WeeRT and InfluxDB

WeeRT stores incoming real-time packets into measurement
`wxpackets`. These are then aggregated and subsampled regularly
(typically, every 5 minutes) into another measurement, `wxrecords`.

Data in `wxpackets` use a 24 hour retention policy --- they are purged
if older than 24 hours.  Data in `wxrecords` are retained
indefinitely.

### Schema

InfluxDB does not use a schema. Nevertheless, data is organized in a
structured, organized way.  Both `wxpackets` and `wxrecords` use
identical structures.

WeeRT uses two InfluxDB *tags*: `platform` and `stream`. The former,
`platform`, is intended to represent a physical presence, such as a
house, car, or piece of industrial machinery.  The latter, `stream`,
represents a data stream within the platform, such as a specific
weather station, or sensor. Like any InfluxDB tags, `platform` and
`stream` are indexed. The default `platform` is `default_platform`;
the default `stream` is `default_stream`.

The observation values, such as `out_temperature`, are stored as
InfluxDB *fields*.  They are not indexed. Because InfluxDB does not
use a schema, new data types can be introduced into the data stream at
any time and they will be stored in the database.

The observation time is stored as field `time` in the database.

## Packets

There are several different ways of representing packet data in the WeeRT / Influx
ecosystem. It's useful to be aware of the differences.

- A __weewx-style packet__. This is the simple, flat data structure
  that weewx uses. It holds time (in integer seconds), field data, and the
  unit system used by the data, but no information about platforms or
  streams. It looks like:
  
   ```json
   {
     "dateTime" : 1507432417,
     "outTemp" : 20.5,
     "outHumidity" : 65.0,
     "usUnits" : 16
    }
    ```

- What we are calling a __deep packet__. This is a structured packet
  that the Node client library
  [node-influx](https://node-influx.github.io/) expects (as do the
  InfluxDB client libraries for most other languages). It is useful
  because the InfluxDB "measurement" and "tags" are explicitly
  represented. Time is in field `time` and it is in *milliseconds*. It
  looks something like this:
 
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp" : 1507432417000,
     "measurement" : "wxpackets",
     "tags" : {"platform" : "Red barn", "stream" : "Accurite"},
     "fields" : {"out_temperature" : 20.5, "out_humidity_percent" : 65.0, "unit_system" : 16}
    }
  ```
    
- What we are calling a __flattened packet__. This is what is returned from the
  [`query`](https://node-influx.github.io/class/src/index.js~InfluxDB.html#instance-method-query)
  function of node-influx. Unfortunately, it is slightly different
  from a deep packet. The tag members have been flattened in with the
  field data, and the time is now in field `time`:
  
   ```json
   {
     "time" : 1507432417000,
     "measurement" : "wxpackets",
     "platform" : "Red barn",
     "stream" : "Accurite",
     "out_temperature" : 20.5,
     "out_humidity_percent" : 65.0,
     "unit_system" : 16
    }
   ```
    
- The InfluxDB [__line
  protocol__](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.2/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/).
  This protocol is designed for on-the-wire efficiency. It is not
  explicitly used within WeeRT. It looks something like this:
 
   ```
   wxpackets,platform="Red barn",stream="Accurite" out_temperature=20.5,out_humidity_percent=65.0,unit_system=16 1507432417000000000
   ```

WeeRT tries to consistently traffic in "deep packets," and does any conversions
that might be necessary. Both incoming and outgoing data use this format.

All mutating calls (POSTs and DELETEs) must be authorized through
an `Authorization` header. It should include
the word `Basic`, followed by the base64 encoding of the username and password
with a colon in between. In Python, this looks like:

```python
import urllib2, base64

...
request = urllib2.Request(url)
base64string = base64.b64encode('%s:%s' % ('johndoe', 'mysecretpassword'))
request.add_header("Authorization", "Basic %s" % base64string)

```

Using `curl`, this can be done by adding the `-u` option, which is done in
the mutating examples below.

## Post a new packet

Post a new packet.

```
POST /api/v1/measurements/:measurement/packets
```

**Header**

The HTTP request must include an `Authorization` header.

**JSON input**

A deep packet must be included in the body of the request.

The packet need not include a value for `measurement`, but, if included,
it must match the value given in the URL.

The packet must include a value for `timestamp` in milliseconds.

Any fields with a `null` value will be ignored and not inserted into the
database.

**Response code**

| *Status* | *Meaning*                         |
|:---------|:----------------------------------|
| 201      | Created                           |
| 400      | Malformed post                    |
| 415      | Invalid or missing `Content-type` |

If successful, the server will return a response code of 201, with the
response `Location` field set to the URL of the newly created resource (packet).

**Example**

Add a new packet for the platform `barn` and stream `accurite`.

```shell
$ curl -u weert:weert -i --silent -X POST -H Content-type:application/json -d  \
>   '{"timestamp" : 1506713320000, \
>   "tags" : {"platform":"barn", "stream":"accurite"}, \
>   "fields" : {"unit_system":1, "out_temperature":56.1, "sealevel_pressure": 29.881}} ' \
>   http://localhost:3000/api/v1/measurements/examples/packets

HTTP/1.1 201 Created

## Delete a specific timestamp

Delete packets with a specific timestamp.


```
DELETE /api/v1/measurements/:measurement/packets/:timestamp
```

**Header**

The HTTP request must include an `Authorization` header.

**Parameters**

| *Name*     | *Type*  | *Description*                                                                                 |

| `platform` | string  | Delete only packets on the platform `platform`.                                               |
| `stream`   | string  | Delete only packets on the stream `stream`.                                                   |

**Response code**

| *Status* | *Meaning*             |
|:---------|:----------------------|
| 204      | Success               |

The same response code (204) is returned irregardless of whether or not any packet fitting the criteria
actually existed in the database.

**Example**

Delete all packets with timestamp `1506713320000`.

```shell
$ curl -u weert:weert -i --silent -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/measurements/examples/packets/1506713320000

## Get meta-information about a measurement.

Query the database for information about an InfluxDB measurement.

```
GET /api/v1/measurements/:measurement
```


**Response code**

| *Status* | *Meaning*             |
|:---------|:----------------------|
| 200      | Success               |
| 404      | Measurement not found |

If successful, the server will return an array whose elements are the series
in measurement `measurement`.

**Examples**

Get information about the measurement `examples`.

```Shell
$ curl -i --silent -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/measurements/examples'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    },
    {
        "platform": "barn",
        "stream": "loft"
    }
]

```

Do the example again, but using a bogus measurement name. It returns
a 404 "Not Found" status code.

```shell
$ curl -i --silent -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/measurements/foo

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

## Get statistics

Return general statistics about a measurement

```
GET /api/v1/measurements/:measurement/stats
```

**Parameters**

| *Name*      | *Type*  | *Description*                                                                                     |
|:------------|:--------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `platform`  | string  | Include only data from platform `platform`. Default is to include all platforms.                  |
| `stream`    | string  | Include only data from stream `stream`. Default is to include all streams.                        |
| `span`      | string  | Return statistics for the given time span. Choices are `day`,`week`, `month` or `year`. Required. |
| `now`       | integer | This variable is a time in nanoseconds somewhere in that `span`. Default is the present time.     |


**Response code**

| *Status* | *Meaning*             |
|:---------|:----------------------|
| 200      | Success               |
| 400      | Malformed query       |

**Example**

Get the statistics for the day surrounding the sample data. Note that only a handful of the returned
values are non-null. This is because statistics, unlike other queries, require a schema to specify not
only which types are to be returned, but also which aggregations are to be run against those types.

For the sample data, most of these types were not inserted into the database. Hence, their statistics are null.

See file `server/config/stats_policies.js` for the schema.

```shell
$ curl -u weert:weert -i --silent -X DELETE 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/measurements/foo'
