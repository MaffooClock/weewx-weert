CONFIGURATION



SERVER

* CQs need to record wind gusts.

Need to record gust directions.



CLIENT

* Live update of "stats" section.

* Multiple plot lines for each plot.

* Check that Metric units work in client.

Add reducers and UI code to deal with failed requests FETCH_TIMESPAN_FAILURE and FETCH_STATS_FAILURE.

Same with FETCH_UPTIME_FAILURE.

Introduce a system of style classes.

Need a timer that at the end of a time spans ('day', 'wee', etc.) emits an event, advancing the chart.

Browser window hangs if it is not the focus for a long period of time.

Look into using react-smooth or react-transition-group instead of d3 to do WindCompass
transition.

Highlight changed values in the "since midnight" stats area.

Take advantage of isFetching in WindCompass




DATABASE

Need utility to load sqlite archived records into InfluxDB.
